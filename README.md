# Overly-Excited

## Requirements

For this exercise, you need to create a single JavaScript function named addExcitement that will use console.log() to print out a sentence to the browser console.

## Stacking Words

Create an ```addExcitement``` function that should ```console.log()``` rows of words. It should take an array containing the words of a sentence and output them in the developer console.

```
Example output:

The
The walrus
The walrus danced
The walrus danced through
The walrus danced through the
The walrus danced through the trees
The walrus danced through the trees in
The walrus danced through the trees in the
The walrus danced through the trees in the light
The walrus danced through the trees in the light of
The walrus danced through the trees in the light of the
The walrus danced through the trees in the light of the moon
...
```

Paste the following code into ```overly-excited.js```

```
// Create an array that contains the words in the sentence
var sentence = [];

// The addExcitement function should accept the array as the sole argument
function addExcitement (theWordArray) {
    /*
      Write a `for` loop that iterates over the array argument and
      outputs the words.
     */
}

// Invoke the function and pass in the array
addExcitement(sentence)
```

## Adding Conditions to the Loop

Then add logic to addExcitement that places an exclamation point (!) after every third word. This will require you to do some basic math in JavaScript, and use an if statement.

Your job is to read the following English statement and write the equivalent in JavaSript code to make it work.

```
If the current value of the counter variable can be evenly divided by 3 - using the JavaScript remainder operator - then add a single exclamation point (!) to the output.
Example output:

The
The walrus
The walrus danced!
The walrus danced! through
The walrus danced! through the
The walrus danced! through the trees!
The walrus danced! through the trees! in
The walrus danced! through the trees! in the
The walrus danced! through the trees! in the light!
The walrus danced! through the trees! in the light! of
The walrus danced! through the trees! in the light! of the
The walrus danced! through the trees! in the light! of the moon!
...
```

## Challenge 

Add logic in the addExcitement function to the increase the number of exclamation points after every third word. The number of exclamation points (!) will be determined by how many times the counter variable can be divided by 3.

```
Example output:

The
The walrus
The walrus danced!
The walrus danced! through
The walrus danced! through the
The walrus danced! through the trees!!
The walrus danced! through the trees!! in
The walrus danced! through the trees!! in the
The walrus danced! through the trees!! in the light!!!
The walrus danced! through the trees!! in the light!!! of
The walrus danced! through the trees!! in the light!!! of the
The walrus danced! through the trees!! in the light!!! of the moon!!!!
...
```
